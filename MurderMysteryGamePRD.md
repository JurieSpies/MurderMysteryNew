Document Version: 1.0

Author: AI Assistant

1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a mobile-first web-based murder mystery game designed for friends to play together online. The game aims to provide an immersive, interactive, and fun experience where players take on character roles, gather clues, interrogate each other, and collectively deduce the murderer, motive, and method.

2. Product Vision & Goals
Product Vision: To create an accessible, engaging, and highly replayable online murder mystery game that fosters social interaction and cooperative deduction among friends, optimized for mobile devices.

Goals (SMART):

Engagement: Achieve an average play session duration of 60-90 minutes per game.

Usability: Ensure 90% of first-time users can navigate and participate in a game without requiring external instructions.

Replayability: Design a system that supports easy creation of new game scenarios (stories, characters, clues).

Performance: Achieve a load time of under 3 seconds on a standard mobile network connection.

Scalability: Support game sessions with 4-8 players initially, with potential for future expansion.

3. Target Audience
Friends looking for interactive online group activities.

Ages 16-45 (adaptable content for different age ranges).

Users comfortable with basic online communication tools (e.g., video conferencing).

Mobile-first users (primarily smartphone users).

4. Scope (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
In Scope:

Single-player-controlled character per person.

One pre-designed murder mystery scenario (e.g., "The Case of the Missing Heiress").

Core game loop: Character assignment, introduction, investigation rounds, accusation, and reveal.

Text-based clue presentation (images/documents as static assets).

Basic in-game chat functionality.

Mobile-first responsive design.

Out of Scope (for MVP):

Complex animations or 3D graphics.

Real-time voice chat integration (relying on external platforms like Zoom/Meet).

Advanced moderation tools.

Multiple game scenarios (will be added in future iterations).

Complex scoring systems or leaderboards.

Backend for user accounts or persistent game states beyond a single session.

In-app purchases or monetization.

5. User Stories / Features
5.1. Game Setup & Lobby

As a User, I want to create a new game session so I can invite my friends to play.

As a User, I want to join an existing game session using a unique game code/link so I can play with my friends.

As a Host, I want to see a list of joined players and their assigned characters.

As a Host, I want to start the game when all players have joined.

As a Player, I want to be assigned a unique character with a name and brief description upon joining.

5.2. Character & Background

As a Player, I want to view my character's background story, personality traits, and objectives (private to me).

As a Player, I want to view my character's secret information that I may or may not reveal.

As a Player, I want to see a general overview of all characters (names, public relationships to victim) to understand the cast.

5.3. Game Introduction

As a Player, I want to see an animated or narrated introduction (e.g., video, rich text with images) describing the crime and setting the scene.

As a Player, I want to receive initial clues relevant to the murder at the start of the game.

5.4. Investigation Phase

As a Player, I want to view all public clues collected so far in a dedicated "Evidence Locker" section.

As a Player, I want to send private chat messages to other players to conduct interrogations.

As a Player, I want to role-play my character by asking and answering questions based on my character brief and secrets.

As a Host, I want to release new sets of clues at predefined intervals during the investigation phase.

As a Host, I want to push public announcements or prompts to all players (e.g., "Time for a new clue!").

5.5. Accusation Phase

As a Player, I want to publicly accuse a character (who I believe is the murderer) and state their motive and method.

As a Host, I want to manage the accusation process, allowing each player to make their final statement.

5.6. The Reveal

As a Host, I want to reveal the true murderer, motive, and method at the end of the game.

As a Player, I want to see a summary of the true events and how all the clues fit together.

6. Technical Requirements
Frontend Framework: React (with Create React App or Vite for quick setup).

Mobile-First Design: Responsive CSS (e.g., using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries) to ensure optimal experience on smartphone screens first, then progressively enhance for tablets/desktops.

State Management: React Context API or a lightweight state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) for global game state.

Styling: CSS Modules or a CSS-in-JS solution (e.g., Emotion, Styled Components) for component-level styling. Tailwind CSS could also be considered for utility-first mobile-first styling.

Routing: React Router DOM for in-app navigation.

Communication: WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time game state synchronization and in-game chat. This will require a simple Node.js/Express.js backend for the WebSocket server.

Data Storage (Game Session): In-memory storage on the WebSocket server for active game sessions. For MVP, no persistent database is needed beyond the duration of a single game.

Content Management (Game Scenarios): Game scenarios (stories, characters, clues, reveal info) will be stored as JSON files on the frontend, easily modifiable by the developer.

Deployment: Static site hosting for the React app (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) and a simple cloud host for the Node.js WebSocket server (e.g., Heroku free tier, DigitalOcean droplet).

Assets: Optimized images (WebP/JPEG) for clues and character profiles. Potentially short audio clips for atmospheric sounds.

7. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)
Clean & Intuitive: Minimalist design, easy-to-read fonts, clear navigation.

Mobile-First Layouts: Design screens vertically, optimize tap targets, ensure content is easily readable without excessive zooming or horizontal scrolling.

Responsive Images: Images (clues, character icons) should scale appropriately.

Visual Cues: Clear indicators for new clues, active players, and private messages.

Immersive Atmosphere: Use thematic colors, fonts, and potentially subtle background imagery to enhance the murder mystery feel.

Feedback: Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions (e.g., button presses, message sent).

8. Game Flow
Host Creates Game: Host visits the app, clicks "Create Game," gets a unique Game Code.

Players Join: Friends use the Game Code to join the lobby. They enter their desired player name.

Character Assignment: Host assigns characters manually or randomly to joined players. Each player receives their private character brief.

Game Start: Host initiates the game.

Introduction Sequence: Animated/narrated intro explaining the victim and setting. Initial public clues appear.

Investigation Rounds:

Players view public clues in "Evidence Locker."

Players interact via in-game chat (public and private messages) and potentially external video call.

Host releases new clues periodically.

Players gather information, form theories, and question each other.

Accusation Phase:

Prompt for each player to formally accuse a character, stating motive and method.

Summary of accusations displayed.

The Reveal:

Host triggers the reveal.

The true murderer is announced.

A narrative explains the full story of the crime.

Game End: Option to start a new game or exit.

9. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
Multiple pre-built game scenarios/stories.

Ability for users to create and share their own game scenarios (content management system for stories).

Integrated voice chat (if viable).

Visual "evidence board" where players can drag and drop clues.

More complex puzzle mechanics (e.g., deciphering codes, virtual lockboxes).

Player roles with special abilities (e.g., "forensic expert" who can access specific clues).

Score tracking for "correct accusation."

User profiles and persistent game history.

This PRD should give your AI agent a solid foundation to begin developing the mobile-first React murder mystery game. Good luck!
